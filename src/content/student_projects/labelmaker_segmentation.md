To mine large-scale training data, [LabelMaker](https://labelmaker.org/) can be used to automatically annotate phone scans. So far, the tool can only output pointclouds. Using the latest advancements in NeRFs and Gaussian Splatting, we develop an efficient pipeline to produce the most accurate possible 3D lifting of segmentation labels into a renderable scene representation.

With this, we build the largest existing indoor semantic segmentation dataset.
