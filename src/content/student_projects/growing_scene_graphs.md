As you walk around in a room with smart glasses on, or as a robot explores a room, we build a growing representation of all observed objects. As soon as the robot or human interacts with an object, we update its pose accordingly. If a door is opened or a drawer pulled out, we update the observed dimensions and add the objects inside as leafs to the drawer node. Over time in this way, we grow a complete, dynamic representation of a scene.

# Requirements
