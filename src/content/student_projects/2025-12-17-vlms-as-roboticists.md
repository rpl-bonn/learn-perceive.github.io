title: VLMs as roboticists
type: master thesis

As VLMs grow more capable, robotics research has focused primarily on direct applications, e.g. VLAs and spatial reasoning. However, VLMs are now proficient at 'computer use' and coding, interacting with standard interfaces like web browsers. We propose to leverage this capability for robotics by enabling VLMs to use the tools roboticists use daily, such as RViz for navigation.
